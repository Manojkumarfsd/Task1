Objects and internal representation
objects are data structures it helps to store the data. We can store with key and values also called as property name and values
represent abstract concept
example:
let person = {
    name : "Manojkumar",
    age : 25,
    gender: "Male",
};
person is a object. 
key or property is (name,age,gender) and value ("Manojkumar",25,"Male")
value can strings,number,boolean,array other object or even functions
objects in java script provide a way to organize and manipulate data.
in java script objects are representing collection of properties each property contains key and value
Objects in javascript are mutable which means we can add, update or remove properties dynamically
